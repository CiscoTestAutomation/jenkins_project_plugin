## pyATS Report Plugin

`It is mandatory to install the pyATS Report Plugin with the pyATS Project plugin to ensure uploading of the result of each build to Cisco Self Serve Services (S3) dashboard and/or Cisco ATS TRADe dashboard.`

The pyATS Report Plugin is a Post Build plugin that can display Cisco test automation results within Jenkins. The plugin extracts and parses the results archive (zip file) generated by Cisco test infrastructure such as Easypy (pyATS) and Autoeasy (tcl ATS) and displays the testcase results within Jenkins. It also provides the option to upload the result of each build to Cisco Self Serve Services (S3) dashboard and Cisco ATS TRADe dasboard.

For more details, refer to the **pyATS Jenkins Report Plugin User Guide**.
